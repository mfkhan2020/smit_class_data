        <h5>Ingredients</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>3 cups (600 g) white basmati rice washed and soaked for 30 minutes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ghee/unsalted butter for cooking the rice with</li>
            <li>8 green cardamoms</li>
            <li>½ cup (75 g) almonds blanched and halved</li>
            <li>small handful sultanas</li>
            <li>¼ cup (65 g) oil/ghee</li>
            <li>2.5 cups (½ kg) white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon red food colour or as needed</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon orange food colour or as needed</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon yellow food colour or as needed</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon green food colour or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the presoaked basmati rice till 75% done with a spoonful of ghee or unsalted butter. Drain and set aside</li>
            <li>In 4 seperate bowls/glasses, add ⅛ teaspoon of each food colour to 1.5 teaspoon of water and spoon in 2tbsp of rice in each bowl/glass. Mix to coat all the rice in the colour. If you feel like you want a stronger colour, add some more food colour. Keep this aside till needed</li>
            <li>In a pot, add your oil/ghee and your blanched almonds, raisins and cardamom. Cook this on a medium high heat, stirring often, till the raisins begin to lightly darken. This shouldn't take longer than 3-5 minutes</li>
            <li>Add your sugar and a splash of water. Cook this on high heat till the sugar granules dissolve into the water. You want to cook this down until the sugar becomes thick and gloopy. The sugar will probably sizzle and bubble a bit and that is fine! You just need to make sure you don't cook the sugar down so much that it becomes hard. There is no set time for how long this will take as it depends on the heat, but mine took about 15 minutes till it became very thick. Also, KEEP STIRRING! If you don't stir, your sugar may darken and this will result in dark looking rice</li>
            <li>Once the sugar has thickened and reduced, add your rice and stir to coat the rice with the sugar. Ideally, there shouldn't be a lot of moisture in the pot. It is OK if you find you have a lot of moisture - mine had loads! Just continue to cook on high until the water has reduced to a small amount.</li>
            <li>Once the water had reduced (the rice will look wet and there will be moisture gathering around the rim of the pot) add the coloured rice to the top as shown in the picture. Turn the heat to the lowest possible setting, cover and allow the Mutanjan to steam cook for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately if you can. If you aren't serving immediately, fluff the rice up so it doesn't stick together - it will have a tendency to do that thanks to all the reduced, sticky sugar! Garnish with a variety of nuts, raisins, mithais etc. Top tip! Layer the coloured rice on the top and white at the bottom, if you can.</li>
